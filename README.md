# Knex Workflow
A place for me to keep notes on how to set up knex in express server

## Install globally in your computer
`npm i -g knex`

## Install locally in your project
1. `npm i --save knex` 
2. in **package.json**, "scripts": {
    "knex": "knex"
  },
  You're saying that when I run `npm run knex` in terminal, I'm referring to the knex module.
